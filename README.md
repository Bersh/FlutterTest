# FlutterTest
This app displays Jake Wharton's Github repositories list.
Loading is done page-by-page through Github REST API. After loading each page content is
stored locally with SQLite. At any moment user can click on any list entry to see details page.
User can force the app to reload all data using pull-to-refresh.
